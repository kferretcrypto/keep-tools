    <H1>Cosmos Validator Comparison Guide</H1>

    <P>Last Updated: August 26, 2020</P>

    <H2>Introduction</H2>
    <P>
      <strong>Note: This guide is currently a work-in-progress.</strong>
    </P>
    <P>
      This guide is designed for those already familiar with running a Cosmos
      Validator to learn more about running a Keep node, or for anyone who
      wishes to compare and contrast the two. Therefore, it assumes that you are
      fairly technical. As with all cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies,
      things can change fairly quickly so please make sure that the version of
      this page you are reading has been updated in the past few months.
    </P>
    <br />

    <H2>Blockchain and Availability</H2>
    <P>
      Keep is currently running in testing on the Ethereum Ropsten testnet. It
      currently facilitates tokenized testnet Bitcoin to be used on Ropsten. The
      token is named tBTC.
    </P>
    <P>
      Cosmos is intended to be a network of thousands of interconnected
      blockchains called the Cosmos Network. The first and currently operating
      blockchain is called the Cosmos Hub, which has a primary token called the
      ATOM (

      </A>
      ).
    </P>

    <br />

    <H2>Node Function</H2>
    <P>
      There are currently two types of Keep nodes available for the public to
      operate: Random Beacon and ECDSA. Random Beacon nodes provide a proven and
      decentralized on-chain source of randomness, which is an essential
      building block for selecting providers for keeps, off-chain containers for
      private data (
      <A href="https://blog.keep.network/whats-in-a-beacon-12c34b0bc078">
        Source: Keep Blog
      </A>
      ). The ECDSA node is responsible for providing a kind of multi-party
      cryptographic service that powers the tBTC system including signing BTC
      transactions.
    </P>
    <P>
      Cosmos Validators run full nodes for the Cosmos Hub blockchain and
      participate in consensus. Essentially, they are responsible for
      constructing and maintaining the security of the blockchain by adding new
      blocks. Validators are also expected to participate in governance by
      voting on proposals (
      <A href="https://hub.cosmos.network/master/validators/validator-faq.html">

      </A>
      ).
    </P>
    <br />

    <H2>Staking and Slashing</H2>
    <P>
      To operate a Keep Random Beacon node on Ropsten, the minimum stake is
      100,000 KEEP. The minimum stake requirement is expected to decrease over
      time but the schedule is not yet known. To operate a Keep ECDSA node
      requires ETH to be made available for bonding. There is no fixed minimum
      amount of ETH, but it should be at least half of the smallest deposit
      transaction available in the tBTC system to be selected for bonding. If an
      operator does not meet the requirements of the operator contract, the
      stake can be slashed and this slashing system is already in effect.
    </P>
    <P>
      The Cosmos Hub is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain so the weight of each
      Validator is determined by how many ATOM tokens are staked. The ATOMs can
      be staked by the owner of the Validator directly or delegated by other
      ATOM holders. Currently, only the top 100 Validators with the most ATOMs
      staked will be Active Validators. The stake can be slashed for
      misbehavior, which currently describes two specific faults: double signing
      or downtime (
      <A href="https://hub.cosmos.network/master/validators/validator-faq.html">

      </A>
      ).
    </P>
    <br />

    <H2>Rewards</H2>
    <P>
      Since Keep is currently running in testing, the rewards for operating Keep
      nodes comes in the form of a program called Playing for Keeps (
      <A href="https://blog.keep.network/how-to-play-for-keeps-297f246455d4">
        Source: Keep Blog
      </A>
      ). In this program, the Keep team rewards community members for
      contributing. In the past, rewards have been given for operating nodes,
      participating in the community, and contributions in various forms,
      including design and technical efforts. The rewards are granted in the
      form of the KEEP token. Larger grants are vested over a one year period
      but will allow for immediate staking in the production version of Keep.
      Smaller grants are in the form of liquid KEEP tokens which are not subject
      to vesting restrictions. In the future, rewards are expected in the form
      of a stakedrop and fee rewards which more directly rewards staking and
      operating nodes.
    </P>
    <P>
      Cosmos Validators and stakers earn from block rewards and transaction
      fees. Block rewards are a form of inflation, i.e. additional ATOMs are
      added to the supply for the purpose of rewarding Cosmos Validators.
      Transaction fees are ATOMs paid by users of the blockchain. The total
      revenue from these two pools are divided among Cosmos Validators based on
      staking weight. The operator of the Cosmos Validator earns more than the
      ATOM stakers who delegated their stake to the Validator (
      <A href="https://hub.cosmos.network/master/validators/validator-faq.html">

      ).
    </P>
    <br />

    <H2>Technical Requirements</H2>
    <P>
      The current requirement to operate a Keep node is a system capable of
      running the Keep clients implemented in Go, as well as all of the
      dependencies of the clients. This is usually a Linux server. The node
      requires reliable connectivity to the Internet and access to an Ethereum
      node, which can be provided by a third party, usually Infura. Systems with
      modest resources are usually capable of running Keep nodes, including
      small VPS instances at common cloud providers. However, nodes with low CPU
      allotment may struggle to run the computations required for an ECDSA node.
      Additionally, these requirements may change when Keep is launched to
      mainnet. Deploying and maintaining Keep clients currently involves
      manually editing configuration files and running cloud or system
      administrator commands, so a certain level of technical knowledge is
      required.
    </P>
    <P>
      The current requirement to operate a Cosmos Validator is a system capable
      of running Gaia, the Cosmos client implemented in Go as well as all of the
      dependencies of the client. This is usually a Linux server with a special
      additional expectation of Hardware Security Module hardware. The node
      requires reliable connectivity to the Internet. Cosmos advises that the
      current resource requirement to operate a Validator is modest but may rise
      as blockchain usage grows. Cosmos warns about possible denial-of-service
      attacks and a recommended strategy to mitigate this risk to connect to
      only trusted nodes. Cosmos projects that when the network is heavily used,
      the bandwidth usage per day may be measured in gigabytes. Cosmos also
      advises that running a successful Validator operation will "require the
      efforts of multiple highly skilled individuals and continuous operational
      attention", and will be much more involved than many other kinds of nodes.
      In short, this is not a "set it and forget it" operation (our words) and
      will likely be suited to professional operators, especially as competition
      rises to be in the top 100 allowed to be an Active Validator (
